# Brendan's Advent of Code 2021

My attempt at solving this year's advent of code. My objective is to improve my algorithm solving skills and learn a new language

Languages I will (hopefully) be attempting with

* Python
* Java
* C++

## Compiling and Running Code

### Java

```
javac Java/*.java
java -cp Java/ Main < test.in
```

### Python

```
python3.10 Python/Main.py
```

### C++

```
g++ -o main Cpp/main.cpp
./main
```
